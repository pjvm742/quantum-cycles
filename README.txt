# quantum-cycles

## Introduction
This is code I have written for my bachelor's thesis, which is about the use of quantum computing for finding cycles in graphs.

## Copyright
The code is licensed to you under the "BSD 3-Clause" license, which is reproduced in the LICENSE file.
The choice of license is more or less forced: in order to have access to free time on D-Wave's quantum computers, I have to release all code I create for using those computers under a permissive software license.
However, I think a permissive license is suitable for this project (hardly any risk of proprietary derivatives harming individuals; fragmentation not considered important, so getting code back not crucial), so it's not a problem and I use the same license for the parts of the code that do not fall under this requirement.
I will note that D-Wave, in their terms & conditions, uses "Open Source License" to mean only a few licenses of their choice, which is misleading.

## Contributing
Please note that code and other contributions might not be used for a variety of reasons:
* not of sufficient quality
* dissimilar in style to the rest of the project
* considered out of scope
* the project may have ceased to be actively maintained

For a contribution to be merged into the repository, you must affirm the following statement:

"
In providing this contribution, I give a guarantee that

	1) I am legally allowed to release the contribution under the applicable public license(s) used by the project
	2) If the contribution is derivative of existing work, I have explicitly indicated the origin of the existing work and complied with all conditions on re-use of the existing work

and

	3) I do indeed release the contribution under the applicable public license(s) used by the project and I agree that the project's way of crediting me is sufficient
	4) I give permission for the relevant information about the contribution, which includes the name and e-mail address I have provided and a copy of my affirmation of this statement, to be stored publicly and spread, indefinitely
"

The above statement itself I place into the public domain with the Creative Commons public domain dedication version 1.0 (CC0), meaning you can do with it whatever you wish.
To my knowledge, I have only read one document with a similar purpose, namely the Linux Foundation's "Developer certificate of origin".
However, many documents with a similar purpose may exist and with enough documents attempting to capture a similar idea, similarities in expression may inevitably arise.

As short-hand for affirming the statement, you may add the following line to your commits:
"
Signed-off-by: [your name] <[your e-mail address]>
"
This can be done automatically with `git commit -s`.
